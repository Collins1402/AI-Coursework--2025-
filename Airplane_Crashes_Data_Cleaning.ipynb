As the pilot tried to steer the aircraft away from the mountain, he realized that the airspeed had decayed to 40 kts., indicating an imminent stall. He decided to dive in order to gain air speed. As he did so the VSI indicated a rate of sink of 2,000 feet per minute while the airspeed remained at 40 kts. Visibility was poor and the pilot did not see the ground till impact at 14,399 feet. Four Italian tourists were killed. Only the pilot survived. It is therefore very likely that the aircraft was caught in a mountain wave that caused the sudden altitude gain and the subsequent stall."

         "The Airbus A320 was leased by XL Airways of Germany since May 2006. The plane was scheduled to be returned to its owner, Air New Zealand. The plane was ferried to Perpignan, France where it underwent maintenance at EAS Industries. During a second test flight, on approach to Perpignan, at 3,500 feet, radio contact was lost. A controller reported seeing the plane descending quickly in a left bank. The aircraft soon after crashed into the sea and broke up."
